% Positive is negative on the scope, thus clockwise
% There is a positive drift in the finction generator, the higher the
% frequency the greater the drift
% Too high of a frequency causes signal to be lost, the more voltage
% provided the higher maximum frequency.
% Higher number in the transfer funtion causes over correcting
% when tating a derivative, throw in a 100/s+100 transfer function
